This is a configuration for the **NeoVIM** editor, My goal in **sharing** and designing this config was to make the most convenient **NeoVim** config for **users**, Since this config is designed for easier use by **users**, People can also contribute to the development of that.

## Prerequisites

* **NodeJS**
* **Vim_Plug**
* **OmniSharp-Roslyn**
* **last Mono Version**
* **PipPython 3.8 or later**

## Description For Better Use of Config
After installing the prerequisites and replacing the config files, edit the `coc-settings.json` file and modify the specified paths.

The `basic.vim` file has default changes such as **vim color** and file format **settings**, the main **keys** are set in the `key.vim` file and **plugins** are introduced in the `plug.vim` file, the change is very easy for you. The **plugin settings** are in the `CfgPlug` folder (Try to choose file names as simple as possible, as it makes editing easier.) Finally, all the changes in the `init.vim` file are called and **introduced to NeoVim**.
